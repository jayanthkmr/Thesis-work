# Thesis Work on Multi-objective Deep Learning

## Description
This repository contains the implementation and findings of my thesis which explores multi-objective deep learning for image and text processing. The project applies various models such as ResNet and LSTM to achieve tasks like image classification and sentiment analysis.

## Abstract
Many current challenges in natural language processing and computer vision have to deal with multiple objectives simultaneously. In this article, we study different methods to solve such multi-objective problem for CIFAR-100 and SEMEVAL datasets and compare with traditional deep learning methods. The multi-output method achieves better results than training a single neural net from scratch with its own model for each objective. Multi-objective deep learning with weights achieves comparable results too.
